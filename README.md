**Before August 12, 2011:** (noun) A sheet printed in colors by any process.

**After:** Your new favorite way of gathering, archiving, and viewing the photos and movies of your life.

<em>This is the Rails port of <a href="http://photostructure.com">PhotoStructure</a></em>.

**Unfortunately, it's not ready for public consumption yet.** Feel free to read on, but know this still a work in progress.

## Why not Google+/Facebook/Flickr?

Between losing your entire cloud-based email account, having privacy
settings changed behind your back, and hundreds of photo sharing sites
going out of business, why *would* you trust a company to store what
amounts to the visual record of your life?

### Why not iPhoto/Picasa/â€¦?

If you've been taking photos regularly for a couple years, you'll have
several hundred *gigabytes* of photos already. Desktop applications like
iPhoto and Picasa don't currently scale up to holding hundreds of thousands
of photos.

## What's the solution?

*Chromotype*. It runs on your local computer, but it can also be used to
share your photos directly -- but *you* are the cloud.

Chromotype imports the photos you have on your computer, even in
your iPhoto and Picasa libraries.

<!-- Coming "soon": It also can import the photos and
movies you previously uploaded in the cloud (like Flickr, Picasa, and
Facebook), and archive those on your computer as well. -->

### Randomness makes you fast
 
Chromotype shows you /shuffled/ views of your photos and
images. Finding that one shot, that "needle in a haystack," is always
only a couple clicks away even if you don't know where to look at first.

<!-- Coming "soon": You can hide photos you don't want to see, give the images you love a
star, and use web services to get your photo printed with just a click
or two. -->

## Nerdy details

### How does this work?

Chromotype is a Ruby on Rails application.

You'll need to install Rails and an RDBMS (sqlite3, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).

### How do I tell Chromotype where my stuff is?

You specify root URIs when you install Chromotype. They're stored
in the ```settings``` table.

### How do the models interact?

There are only two main models:

* ```tags```, which are hierarchical and polymorphic
* ```assets```, which represents a thing that can be tagged, like an image.

When Chromotype starts, it recurses through each root URI, finds interesting things, extracts features, and imports.

Currently only local filesystems are supported.
